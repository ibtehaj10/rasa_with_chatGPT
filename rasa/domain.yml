  - text: "Selected participants are notified by push notification, email, and direct message in the app with instructions on how to confirm their reservation. Merchants send these notifications via the platform at different times, as indicated in the rules published for each event.
            Unselected participants are notified at the merchants' discretion after the expiry of the confirmation deadline for their individual event(s)."

  utter_answer_2:
  - text: "No, 'Just Ended' is not related to winner selection. 
            All events remain 'Current' for 3 days following the close of registration before moving to 'Just Ended' where they remain for 7 days before being permanently archived.
            An event that has moved to the 'Just Ended' tab simply means that it has been 3 days since registration closed and does not imply that the entry was either selected or not selected. These timing rules apply to all events and are unrelated to winner selection or notification."

  utter_answer_3:
  - text: "Certain events require a Special Events Link to access registration.
            To access the latest event links, check Upcoming Events in the app and tap 'More Info' if available or visit our Special Events Registration page.
            Make sure to follow @copdate  and your local shops on social media for release announcements, info, and links."

            Copdate does not manage invoicing, logistics or fulfillment for our retail partners. Each merchant handles their own fulfilment of products reserved using the platform.
            For events where shipping and/or invoicing is required, users with confirmed reservations will receive an invoice / purchase instructions directly from the merchant typically within 1-2 business days following the payment of the reservation fee.
            You can consult the event rules by tapping the 'Rules' button on your reservation.
            For all questions about your invoice, order status, or shipping updates, please reach out to the merchant directly and they will be able to assist you further.
            Rest assured that if you have a confirmed reservation, your product is secured."

  - text: "If you are seeing an 'Unrecognized Account' error when submitting the form, it is most likely due to a typo or error in the form.
            The information submitted in the form must be identical to your Copdate account profile.
            Please ensure that the following info matches your Copdate account exactly (like a login):
             First name
             Last name
             Email
            Once all the above fields in the form match your account profile, your submission  will work normally."

            Check your card statement to verify whether the charge is marked 'Pending' or 'Processing'.
            If a charge is marked 'Pending', this means that the payment has not been processed. Please contact your card provider directly to inquire as to the status of the payment or any charges appearing on your statement.
            Once the payment has been successfully processed, your entry will be updated and your Boost will be reflected in the app.

  utter_answer_9:
  - text: "Boost is available in limited quantities from the time eligible entries are processed until all available Boost has been claimed or the event is closed.
            It is not possible to purchase Boost after an event is closed.
            If you are getting an 'Oops! Invalid Token‚Äù error message when attempting to purchase, it means either that the event is closed or that all available Boost for that event has been already been claimed."
